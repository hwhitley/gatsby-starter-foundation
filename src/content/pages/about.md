I am from Colonial Heights, Virginia - just south of Richmond right of I-95. I graduated with a B.A. from Virginia Tech in May 2020, where I majored in International Studies with a concentration in National Security and Foreign Policy and a minor in Arabic. I have worked as a lifeguard for six years and managed pool operations for the last three of those years. I currently work as an equipment manager for the football team at Virginia Tech; I specifically work with the quarterbacks and assist with daily practices and equipment room operations. I also serve as Dr. Mike Horning's research assistant on his News Transparency Project funded by the National Science Foundation. The goal of our study is to investigate the ways in which we can build trust between news organizations and consumers.
